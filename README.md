# <h1 align="center"> :purple_circle: Workshop with Spring Boot and MongoDB :purple_circle: </h1>

Repository created for the project (Workshop Web Services). <br /> <br /> In this project, I used Spring Boot, is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework.
In addition to, I used MongoDB, MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases.
NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data.
MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information. <br /> <br />
